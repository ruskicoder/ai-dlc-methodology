# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for comprehensive documentation of Kiro's Spec-Driven Development methodology and AI-Driven Development Lifecycle. The documentation must capture every aspect of how Kiro's agentic AI system operates, including workflow phases, constraints, task execution, steering mechanisms, and developer interaction patterns. This documentation will serve as a complete reference for understanding and potentially replicating Kiro's autonomous coding methodology while maintaining human oversight.
